\section{Conclusions}

We proposes a Feedback Convolusional Neural Networks for class model visualization and object localization. 
Our Feedback Neural Networks can infer the hidden neuron status given the bottom level input image and top level class labels.
Experiments on ImageNet localization challengeindicates that our model is superior in weakly supervised object localization, and further experiments demonstrate its powerfulness in distinguishing objects, even under cluttered backgrounds with multiple objects.
