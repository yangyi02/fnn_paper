\section{Conclusion \& Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a Feedback Convolutional Neural Network architecture in this paper, which achieves the \emph{top-down} selectivity of neuron activations by jointly reasoning the outputs of class nodes and the activations of hidden layer neurons during the feedback loop. The proposed Feedback CNN is capable of capturing high level semantic concepts and project the information down to image representation as salience maps. Benefiting from the feedback mechanism of our model, we utilize the salience map to build a unified deep neural network for both recognition and object localization tasks, to answer questions of both \emph{``What''} and \emph{``Where''} simultaneously. Experimental results on ImageNet 2014 object localization Challenge show that our model could achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-arts, using only weakly supervised information. We also show the feedback could improve image classification task by re-focusing the network onto those salient regions.

We foresee the potential of Feedback CNN to further improve various computer vision and machine learning tasks, such as fine-grained recognition, object detection, and multi-tasks learning. However, instead of simulating the human vision system, we attribute the improvement of Feedback CNN to the efficiency in utilizing computation resources.
