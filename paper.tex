%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
While feedforward deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been a great success in computer vision, it is important to remember that the human visual contex contains generally more feedback connections than foward connections. In this paper, we will briefly introduce the background of feedbacks in the human visual cortex, which motivates us to develop a computational feedback mechanism in the deep neural networks. The proposed networks perform inference from image features in a bottom-up manner as traditional convolutional networks; while during feedback loops it sets up high-level semantic labels as the “goal” to infer the activation status of hidden layer neurons. The feedback networks help us better visualize and understand on how deep neural networks work as well as capture visual attention on expected objects, even in the images with cluttered background and multiple objects.
