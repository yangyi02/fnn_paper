%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Deep convolutional neural networks have been proven to be a very powerful method in computer vision. In this paper, we will briefly introduce the background of feedbacks in the human visual cortex, which motivates us to develop a computational feedback mechanism in the deep neural networks in the past several weeks. The feedback philosophy helps us to visualize the neural network and understand deeper on how deep neural network works, especially for the deep convolutional neural networks. The feedback framework is also extended to re-train the neural networks to better explore the properties of the natural images to avoid overfitting as well as improve the image recognition accuracy. We show will discuss the plans on future improving the feedback neural network architectures.
