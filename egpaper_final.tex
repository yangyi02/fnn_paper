%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Deep convolutional neural networks have been proven to be a very powerful method in computer vision. In this paper, we will briefly introduce the background of feedbacks in the human visual cortex, which motivates us to develop a computational feedback mechanism in the deep neural networks in the past several weeks. The feedback philosophy helps us to visualize the neural network and understand deeper on how deep neural network works, especially for the deep convolutional neural networks. The feedback framework is also extended to re-train the neural networks to better explore the properties of the natural images to avoid overfitting as well as improve the image recognition accuracy. We show will discuss the plans on future improving the feedback neural network architectures.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Dataset}

\subsection{Experiment Details}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only set feedback on RELU layer 
  \item Train multi-class feedback model with hidden variable sharing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visualization of feedbacks}
A figure shows Feedback vs No-Feedback visualization on fc8

Key story: Feedback surpress noise and extract salient part region and contexts

\subsection{Where to Add Feedback}
A figure shows Feedback vs No-Feedback visualization on conv5 etc. \\

Key story: 1. Not all layers need feedback 2. Feedback surpress noisefor high level layers

\subsection{Are the Activation Similar for different classes}
A figure shows Feedback visualization on fc8 for different classes \\

Key story: 1. Feedbacks are different for different classes in the same image. 2. Some similar classes share similar feedbacks

\subsection{Are feedback helpful for recognition?}

\subsection{Are feedback useful for localization}
A figure shows Feedback visualization for different object classes for the same image (a little similar to above)

\subsection{Are feedback robust to noise}
A figure shows Feedback visualization for an image producing a different class label than ground truth (similar as the \"intriguing property\" paper)

\subsection{How iterative update changes visualization}
A figure shows the visualization with update iteration

\subsection{Are feedback helpful for multi-task learning?}

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be
found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.  For conference
submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the
reviewer to go to a techreport for further details.  Thus, you may say in
the body of the paper ``further details may be found
in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the techreport as additional material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.
